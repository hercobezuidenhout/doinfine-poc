# DoinFine ðŸ‘Œ
DoinFine is an app (currently PWA) that enables teams to keep each other accountable and build team culture while doing it. 

## The Fine System
The Fine System is a simple system where teams fine each other for a specific act. The member who was fined should then do something to pay back their fine. There are a couple of rules to this to comply to the DoinFine Manifesto.

### Rules
1. One can not simply fine someone. A fine request must be submitted which must the be approved by the majority of the team. 
2. One can not simply pay back a fine. A payment request must be submitted which must be approved by the majority of the team. 
3. One has the ability to reject a fine request towards them. 
4. Anonymity is important for keeping team culture and to avoid salty situations.

## Tech Stack
The app currently exists out of a `React Web App` and a `.NET Web API` which is set up as a `PWA` so that it can run on a mobile device.

It is deployed to a Google Cloud infrastructure and Firebase.
